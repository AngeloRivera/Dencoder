Dencoder is a collection of tools that allow HandBrakeCLI to work from a network based queue.  Multiple HandBrakeCLI instances can run across any number of computers (Mac's at this time) in order to speed up the process.

RabbitMQ is used as the queue handler though technically any AMQP implementation would work.  More information about how the project works is coming.
